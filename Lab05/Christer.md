In order to scan all ports of the target system, `nmap` together with the target IP has to be utilized. This can be done using the following command: `-nmap -Pn -T4 -A -p- 10.225.149.170`. `-Pn` meaning Dont Ping, enables nmap to perform its function regardless if the target is active or not. `-T4` sets the speed of the scan, which scans the ports quickly without omitting important information. `-A` means Agressive Scan, and enables nmap to scan important information like OS, version, script and traceroute. Finally `-p-` specifies that all the ports of the target system should be scanned.

Using the given commands, Nmap scans all the ports of the target system, and confirms that ports `22`, `1337` and `7331` are open. However, it also states that port `1337` is the `Wrong port :)`, and therefore we proceed to the next port. `7331` is the last open port, and it is returning data. This means that the webpage should be located in this last open port.

The target webpage is found when the target IP and the correct port number 7331 is entered into the browser (http://10.225.149.170:7331/). On this page, the flag is revealed:
